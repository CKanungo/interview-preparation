The Impact of Global Warming from Big Geographical Data
~~~~
Project Description
~~~~
The issue of Global Warming has been a controversial topic over the past decades. President-elect even claimed it is a made-in-China topic. The impact of global warming can truly be devastating to our planet. 
For example, 40% of population in the Netherlands are exposed to the risk of drowning. 
Growing sea level resulted from global warming can lead to submerging cityâ€™s land like Manhattan. We are looking for evidence from big geographical data, evaluating the impact of global warming and Mr. Trump statement as well.
